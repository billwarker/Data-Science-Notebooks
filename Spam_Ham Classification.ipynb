I'm also going to ignore all stop words (i.e. common words like 'it', 'the', 'is') by running the dictionary results through the stopwords dataset found in the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) module.

Since the accuracies were so high for each model, I didn't do any tweaking of hyperparameters to try and improve them. I also ignored checking for precision or recall, since at ~99% accuracy they're both pretty obvious. While an interesting exercise, it says little about the viability of these models in an real online environment. The algorithms I used to extract the features weren't even good enough to judge the emails solely on their contents - the two most important features in the Decision Tree were containnd in the email headers. Future, improved versions of this exercise would involve a much larger dataset of more diverse emails, and an improved algorithm for extracting the word features.\n",
